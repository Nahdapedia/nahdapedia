### What is this?
This project is intended as an academic open effort to catalogue and preserve the recorded legacy of Egyptian musical art at the turn of the 20th century, a period commonly referred to as the "Nahda era" by previous authors.

It builds upon the pioneering work "Musiciens et poètes en Egypte au temps de la Nahda" by Frédéric Lagrange, aiming to update it with recent discoveries in this field which were not available back in 1994. These recent discoveries were made more accessible to the public in more recent times by organizations such as the AMAR Foundation for Arab Music Archiving & Research.

The project aims to achieve this mission in a collective open-source endeavour where people can participate, correct, and add entries to the "database".

Being an open source endeavour, and for the sake of a more lasting preservation, the underlying data will be freely available in an online code repository under an appropriate open source license, which will be outlined soon. The data can thus be easily "cloned" or "forked" by any interested individual, and it will not be owned by any single person or organization.

The project is expected to be a reference for musicians, authors, academics, archivists, record collectors and listeners interested in Egyptian music at the turn of the century by providing complete, accurate, and referenceable data.

### How can I get involved?
This is still a nascent project and the website and the underlying data framework are still undergoing rapid changes and should be considered "unstable". Please keep your eye on this space as we publish instructions on how to contribute to the project.
